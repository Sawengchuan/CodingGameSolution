## The Ultimate Test 
##### https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-ultimate-test

Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the digits of a number N such that the result is K(a number).

For an example N = 123456789 and K = 100

Explanation : 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 + 78 + 9 = 100.
(This is just 1 case, you are supposed to find all of them).

NOTE : When there is nothing between the numbers they get appended.
NOTE : The order of the digits should not be changed.
NOTE : Ordering priority is nothing > + > - .
NOTE : There is no 0 involved in N.
